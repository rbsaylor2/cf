Lehigh congratulates its account Blue Diamond Growers on their recent Million Work Hours Award from the National Safety Council. The award recognizes the Blue Diamond Salida manufacturing plant in California for achieving 2 million consecutive work hours without an occupational injury or illness resulting in days away from work from June 2015 to September 2017. The plant employs 558 workers.

Blue Diamond President and CEO Mark Jenson said, "Ensuring the safety of our more than 1,500 employees is the highest priority in all Blue Diamond's operations. Less than half a percent of manufacturing facilities this size have achieved this milestone."

As the leader in managed safety footwear programs, a vital part of decreasing workplace lost-time injuries, we share our account’s dedication and drive to a zero harm culture and support them in their continued pursuit of safety excellence.
