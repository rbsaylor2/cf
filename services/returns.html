  <h2>Easy and Convenient Returns</h2>
  <p>Safety Shoes have to fit perfectly, and sometimes they don't. So we offer (what we consider to be) the easiest, fastest and FREE returns process in the industry. All of your orders placed through your CustomFit site are saved and are easily accessible in the Order History list on your site. Identify the order you would like to return, click the Return button and your free FedEx shipping label immediately pops up. Just print the label, adhere to your re-packaged boots and drop them off at any FedEx location. Once we receive it at our warehouse, we'll inspect it and immediately issue credit to your account. It's that simple. No need to pick up the phone, no questions asked, and most importantly, no waiting. Your time is valuable, and we understand that, so we've developed a returns process that allows you to do things on your own time and with as little effort as possible.</p>
