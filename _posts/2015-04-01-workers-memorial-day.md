Every year April 28th is WORKER'S MEMORIAL DAY - a day of remembrance for all those who have died on the job. It's also a time to bolster the extreme value in workplace safety. We can't undo what's been done but we can prevent future loss. Lehigh stands with you in your commitment to a high standard of quality and safety by providing the best possible selection of safety footwear. We strive to provide top-notch service and program options so that you can have peace of mind knowing your workers feet are protected.

Today also marks the 44th anniversary of OSHA being established. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 gives employers the responsibility of providing a safe and healthy workplace. OSHA's job is to ensure set standards are being met as well as providing training, education and assistance.

We encourage everyone in a company from top to bottom to always maintain a mindset of precaution, awareness and knowledge of their work area and others around them - you could be saving a life. Stay safe.
