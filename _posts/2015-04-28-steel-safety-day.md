One of Lehigh's core values is safety and we support any initiative that shares and promotes that value to the customers we serve. Last year the World Steel Association (WSA) established Steel Safety Day to reinforce creating and maintaining a safer work environment across the entire steel industry. Before this year's Steel Safety Day on April 28th the industry was encouraged to conduct an extensive safety audit with the goal of raising awareness and achieving an injury-free, illness-free workplace.

The WSA defined the 5 most common major causes of workplace safety incidents to focus on - moving machinery, falling from heights, falling items, gas and asphyxiation, and moving cranes. Each year one of the causes will be highlighted with knowledge and information for prevention. This year focuses on moving machinery. Check out this detailed graphic the WSA put together to help better understand the safety practices to reduce risk.

##In Addition

The above practices are excellent points in helping to prevent an occurance or hazard. Lehigh also highly recommends always enforcing a safety footwear policy and requirement to ensure protection in the event of an accident. For the steel industry our most commonly purchased footwear is MetGuards. This type of boot incorporates an extra piece of durable material that lays on top of the boot to protect the metatarsal bones of the foot from heavy impact. Lehigh carries a wide variety of styles in both internal and external options. If you have a CustomFit account check them out here.
