<p>Across the US, more then 80,000 construction workers suffer an injury on the job site every year. That’s incredible; and it’s obviously way too many. So, the over 40 national and global construction firms making up CISI (the Construction Industry Safety Initiative) and IIF (the Incident and Injury-Free Executive Forum) have come together for the 2nd Annual US Industry Safety Week May 3rd through the 9th.</p>

<p>Construction firms of all sizes across the country are encouraged to work together to eliminate worker injury. SafetyWeek2015.com states the collective mission of the campaign is to partner together in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thanking workers for supporting safety and recognizing their efforts to be injury free</li>
  <li>Increasing awareness of the importance of being committed to safety, every day</li>
  <li>Inspiring all of us to share best practices and to work together to strengthen our industry’s safety culture</li>
  <li>Celebrating the need to be injury free</li>
  <li>Conducting on-site safety awareness activities to support education</li>
  <li>Companies, Safety Directors, Foremen, Shift Supervisors and Human Resources need to take this opportunity to recommit and focus-in on reducing jobsite injuries. If not this week, designate another specific week for your workers to demonstrate your commitment to the value of their lives and the work they do. Pledge to make a difference and to be a leader in safety.</li>
