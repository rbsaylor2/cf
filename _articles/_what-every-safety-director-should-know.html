  <h2>Overall Safety is vital to a successful business operation</h2>
  <p>While this white paper provides an easy-to-use guide to help determine
the right footwear for a specific work environment, we must first talk
broadly about the priority of instituting proper workplace safety regulations,
procedures and practices. Whether your company has five employees
or 5,000, workplace safety is vital for protecting the individual as
well as ensuring that your business is compliant with industry standards
set forth by OSHA (Occupational Safety & Health Administration) within
the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>The Occupational Safety and Health Act passed in 1970 established
OSHA with the mission of “assuring safe and healthful working conditions
for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by
providing training, outreach, education and assistance”1 and covers most
private sector employers in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and
other U.S., jurisdictions. It’s General Duty Clause requires an employer
to comply with the Act and regulations derived from it, and to provide
employees with “employment and a place of employment which are free
from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or
serious physical harm to his employees.”</p>
