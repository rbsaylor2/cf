  <p class="lead">As you know, your feet are 3-dimensional - length, width and height. Unfortunately, all tools used to measure feet are only 2-dimensional - length and width. Since everybody's feet are different it can sometimes be hard to measure your TRUE shoe size. Lehigh Outfitters also carries a wide range of styles and brands; and not all brands are built the same. So if you are familiar with the brand you plan to purchase, we recommend ordering the same size you normally wear in that brand. If you are new to a brand it is still best to go with the size you are currently wearing assuming they are a comfortable fit.</p>
  <p>If you need to find your size, use one of the options below.</p>
  <h2>Option 1:</h2>

  <h2>Option 2:</h2>
  <p>Meaure your feet with the below charts to help determine your shoe size according to your foot length and width in inches. The cart measurements represent industry standard.</p>
  <p>When measuring your foot, stand on a solid surface wearing socks that you intend to wear with the shoes you are planning to purchase. Place a ruler on the ground. Place your heel at the lowest end. Read the number where your longest toe ends. Use this number with the below chart.</p>
