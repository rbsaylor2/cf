  <p class="lead">With over 3,000 styles to choose from, needless to say, we know a thing or two about footwear. One of the most common questions that continues to pop up for our blue-collar customers is the difference between steel and composite toe work boots. We've got the selection, but selecting steel toe or composite toe can be down to preference.</p>

  <p>Some people are fans of footwear with composite toe caps, while others can be fans of footwear made with steel toe caps. We are proponents of both. They both keep your feet safe to the same required standard but due to the material they are made from, have different properties. Footwear made with either of these toe caps are tested to the same ASTM F2413-05 Standard Impact Compression requirements.</p>

    <h2>Steel Toe Boots</h2>
    <p>Steel toe work boots are the go-to protective toe type for compression and other toe protection. Stay protected on the job with many different styles to choose from.</p>
    <p>Our steel toe boots are built to last and steel is a familiar material to most people. Prevent accidents from falling objects or other toe-related hazards with proper protective footwear. Our steel toe boots meet industry standard requirements while offering the slim toe box that you may prefer from your work shoe.</p>
    <p>Steel toe boots, while offer the same protection as composite, can create annoyances if your job requires interaction with a metal detector. Another potential dissadvantage is that they typically hold a colder temperature longer than composite.</p>

    <h2>Composite Toe Boots</h2>
    <p>Composite toe work boots provide an alternative to metalic protective footwear for those wanting the same protection from a different material.</p>
    <p>The main reason for composite toe shoes is areas where protective toe footwear is needed along with people needing to pass through metal detectors such as in prisons or with the transportation industry. Composite toe caps used in footwear with other non-metallic components is ideal for this use.</p>
    <p>One potential downside to composite toe is the fact that they <em>can</em> break and it's important to replace a shoe if something has damaged it (i.e. a heavy object falling on it). Another consideration is that they typically don't have as slim of a toe profile as steel.</p>

  <h2>What's The Difference in Steel Toe and Composite Toe Work Boots?</h2>
  <p>Many people believe that composite toes work better for cold weather and high heat conditions since steel reacts differently to these temperature extremes. Cold weather boots and high heat boots have been made for years with steel toe caps aided by the other materials used in the footwear. We have seen no proof that steel toe caps perform better or worse than composite toes in adverse temperatures.</p>
  <p>The protective work boots and shoes that we sell all pass the <em>same safety standard</em> that ensures the <em>same protection</em>, regardless of the material. While steel and composite offer their advantages and disadvantages for each use-case, it's up to you to decide which is most appropriate for your job.</p>
