  <p class="question">What exactly is CustomFit?</p>
  <p class="answer">Good question! Geting custom fit may conjure up an image of going to the gym, and although it has nothing to do with getting physically fit, it does have everything to do with making sure your safety footwear program is as efficient as it can be, and that means taking it off of your plate. After seing much frustration and unncessary headaches in the accounts we were serving with shoe trucks, we chose to listen to what they needed and developed an online solution we call CustomFit because it allows us to customize your program to specifically fit your needs.Check out the many services we provide .</p>

  <p class="question">What if my shoe size does not show on a certain style?</p>
  <p class="answer">To help prevent backorders and out of stock issues, our website will not display any style in which we do not have inventory; and therefore, a size will not show. We apologize for the inconvenience and would be happy to help you find a similar style that we do have in stock. Please click Live Support above, call, email, or fill out the form to the right for assistance.</p>
  <p class="question">What if I order a product from the website that is out of stock or discontinued?</p>
  <p class="answer">If there is a stock issue with your order, we will notify you within 48 hours. Not only that, but our highly trained service reps. will give you a backorder delivery date and suggest a similar style for replacement. This takes the stress of managing a shoe program off of your shoulders. It’s what we do and oddly enough, it’s what we like to do!</p>
  <p class="question">How do vouchers work?</p>
  <p class="answer">For managers, a voucher program is an easy way to control which employees are currently eligible to purchase their boots, helps you keep track of who has already purchased their safety shoes and is a quick and easy way to connect an invoice to the appropriate employee. </p>
  <p class="question">With so many different brands, what is your warranty?</p>
  <p class="answer">Lehigh warranties all protective toe products against manufacturer defect for 1 year (365 days) from the date of purchase when used under normal conditions for the purpose intended. All the many brands of footwear and apparel we offer also have their own warranty which may be greater than 365 days, but it is up to their discreation to fulfill that warranty.</p>
  <p class="question">Isn't it easier for a truck to fit multiple employees?</p>
  <p class="answer">It's actually a lot easier and time-saving to provide all of your employees 24/7 online access to buying their safety footwear. That means no truck lines of employees waiting in cold or rainy weather to try on a limited selection in a tiny cramped area one at a time when they could be working. A shoe truck is not an efficient or profitable solution for either of us - <a href="/about/overview">that's why we created CustomFit</a>.</p>
