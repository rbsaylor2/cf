  testimonial: "We here at IDG-Corning Gilbert would like to take a moment to tell you thank you for setting up our CustomFit website. Using the CustomFit website for our industrial shoe needs has been a big time saver for us and our employees. Having the custom-made posters posted for our employees to look at and see all of the options available to them makes the ordering process much easier. We are very happy with how easy it is to navigate the site and get any information that we need in the ordering process. One of the things that has been very useful for IDG is the quick order confirmations that you get when you place the order. Also in the event there is a need for a return the process that is set up through our CustomFit website makes it a no hassle transaction.

The process for ordering shoes here previously was to give the employee a voucher and they had to go and pick them up. With the CustomFit Website we have cut down on the time needed to order by 10 minutes and the employee no longer has to go and get the shoes.

For anyone that has to order a lot of shoes and would like to make it easy we would like to recommend that you show them your CustomFit Website."

  testimonial: "The CustomFit web page offered by Lehigh Outfitters has proved to be a valuable tool for equipping our employees with Metatarsal boots. The District Sales Manager offered the program during a Safety Awareness Week expo and quickly set up a model for us to evaluate. After the evaluation and approval to set up the custom website to our needs, we quickly had the ability to purchase metatarsal boots! The ease of ordering, low cost and free shipping exceeded all of our expectations. We have over 1000 employees that are in need of boots at any given time and this program works out great for us. Their CustomFit website program is just that (CustomFit). In some cases, we had the need to ship boots back (because of size issues) and Lehigh quickly set up a return process on our CustomFit website to expedite the return and re-shipment, the shipping and returns are free too. I am pleased to say that not only has Lehigh helped us to meet our goals to get our employees metatarsal boots, but they have taken the customer service to the next level. Thank you!"

  testimonial: "Just wanted to give you an update on our CustomFit program. We've had the website up and running and people ordering shoes for almost 2 weeks now. I've been pleasantly surprised with the ease of the whole process! Initially I was a little concerned about people finding it difficult to navigate, but it really has turned out to be the easiest process for us. We've even had success with our Spanish speaking population. No issues to date. The return process has also been smooth. Of the 35 pairs of shoes that have been ordered so far, only 1 has been returned, and that was quick and painless as well. Thank you for all your help setting this up for us, I am a convert!"

Lehigh’s IT group worked with us to customize a data management system which allowed for more accurate data input and reporting. Lehigh’s web-based ordering interface is specific to our company and is available 24/7 and the Lehigh Creative Team even provided iPad based kiosks as a convenient ordering alternative. Pricing is competitive, which has resulted in a substantial savings over traditional ‘brick and mortar only' retail options."
