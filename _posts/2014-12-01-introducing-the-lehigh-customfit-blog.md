As a product and service provider of safety footwear for over 90 years, we’ve learned a thing or two; and we’d like to share that knowledge as well as let everyone know how we can help you improve your program. So we started a blog we’re calling FootPrints cause we believe we’ve made and will continue to make an impression on the safety footwear industry and we’re putting all of that expertise in print ;-)

We’ll talk about other ways to help keep you safe at work and at home as well, throw in a little sense of humor, ask your opinion, and hopefully inspire you to love your job. Follow us on Facebook andTwitter to stay on top of regular FootPrints posts and [check it out here](http://lehighcustomfit.wordpress.com/).
