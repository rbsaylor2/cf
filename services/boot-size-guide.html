    <h1>Boot Size Guide</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lead">As you know, your feet are 3-dimensional - <strong>length, width and height</strong>. Unfortunately, all tools used to measure feet are only 2-dimensional - length and width. Since everybody's feet are different it can sometimes be hard to measure your TRUE shoe size. Lehigh Outfitters also carries a wide range of styles and brands; and not all brands are built the same. So if you are familiar with the brand you plan to purchase, we recommend ordering the same size you normally wear in that brand. If you are new to a brand it is still best to go with the size you are currently wearing assuming they are a comfortable fit.</p>
