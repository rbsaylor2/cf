  <h2>Comfortable Work Boots</h2>
  <p>Georgia Boot was the first brand to deliver true comfort in work boots with the innovation of Comfort Core® Technology and continues to develop superior comfort features.</p>
  <p>Their patented Comfort Core® insole design incorporates an energy-return heel plug that stores energy as it's compressed by the wearer's foot and then releases it as the foot is lifted. This revolutionary feature has lead to other insole technology such as the AMP™ (Advanced Memory Polyurethane) footbed which has a unique dual-layer of Polyurethane and Memory Foam and the CC5 footbed with ergonomic arch support and superior airflow for cooling.</p>

  <p>Because of a special tanning process, SPR™ leather is 3 times stronger and 2.5 times more abrasion resistant than conventional leather offering protection against barnyard and pasture chemicals. Built with durable, long-lasting real rubber combined with a unique blend of proprietary materials, the Carbo-Tec™ outsole is chemical, oil and highly slip-resistant.</p>
