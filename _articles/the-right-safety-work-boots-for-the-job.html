  From Steel Toe to Puncture Resistant, Static Dissipative, Electical Hazard and so on, plus an abundance of comfort features; Safety footwear can have a lot of bells and whistles. Sifting through the saturation of brands, styles (hiker, wellington, 8-inch, etc.) and components and matching them up to your specific work conditions can be daunting. So where do you start and what do you need to consider?

  <h2>Workplace Hazards and Safety Footwear</h2>
  Every work environment is different. Even if you have a specific trade, you may still encounter various work conditions from jobsite to jobsite, building to building, or room to room. So it's important to think about all the areas you and your employees will face when doing required work.

  Footwear manufacturers are constantly striving to provide products that meet the need of specific work conditions or industry. A great example of this is the Rocky Elements collection - trade specific boots with distinct features and benefits to accommodate demanding job conditions and duties. Check out the promo video below.

  In general, safety footwear is designed to help protect
  a worker from at least one of the following hazards

  <ol>
    <li>Falling, rolling and flying</li>
    <li>Punctures</li>
    <li>Cutting Hazards</li>
    <li>Slips, Trips and Falls</li>
    <li>Burns</li>
    <li>Electrical Harm</li>
    <li>Fatigue</li>
    <li>Extreme temperatures / weather</li>
  </ol>

  The above workplace hazards are pretty basic and probably didn't surprise you. Why? Cause they're common sense. But since accidents are still happening workers must be thinking it's not going to happen to them - and that's probably cause it hasn't happened YET. But bad practices eventually lead to injury so it's best to learn, instruct and enforce wearing the right boot for the job.

  Below is a handy chart of some of the more common features available in safety footwear and the benefit of each as well as how it applies to the above hazards and what job or work environment might require it.
