  <p class="lead">Along with providing top quality safety footwear, Lehigh believes excellent service and maintaining efficiency and security are essential to doing good business. Our Employee Data Exchange option will help you better manage your Corporate Safety Shoe Program.</p>
  <h2>What Does The  Data Integration Involve?</h2>
  <p>Your CustomFit safety footwear website will be loaded with your specific employee data which will allow for greater management of their eligibility and your entire safety footwear program. This integration of employee data into our system will provide you with many benefits, especially if you have a large number of employees to manage and buy from us exclusively.</p>

  <h2>Voucher Program Option</h2>
  <p>Our Employee Data Exchange option works best when your company purchases exclusively from Lehigh CustomFit. Why? Cause outside purchases from other vendors or retail stores won't be able to be tracked, monitored or reported through our system.</p>
  <p>If you use multiple venders our <a href="#">Voucher Program</a> may be a better fit for your company.</p>
