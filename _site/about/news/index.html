The award recognizes the Blue Diamond Salida manufacturing plant in California for achieving 2 million consecutive work hours without an occupational injury or illness resulting in days away from work from June 2015 to September 2017. The plant employs 558 workers.</p>

<p>Blue Diamond President and CEO Mark Jenson said, “Ensuring the safety of our more than 1,500 employees is the highest priority in all Blue Diamond’s operations. Less than half a percent of manufacturing facilities this size have achieved this milestone.”</p>

<p>As the leader in managed safety footwear programs, a vital part of decreasing workplace lost-time injuries, we share our account’s dedication and drive to a zero harm culture and support them in their continued pursuit of safety excellence.</p>

<p>![Congrats! Blue Diamond Growers For 2 Million Hours with no lost-time injuries][http://info.rockybrands.com/rs/018-APH-439/images/cf-email-171128-zeroinjuries.jpg]</p>

<p>“The QuickFit collection is another step forward in Lehigh’s continuing effort to fill the gaps in our customer’s programs to procure durable and dependable footwear for their employees,” said Sarah Milligan, Vice President of Sales and Operations for Lehigh Outfitters. “Our CustomFit kiosks that launched in 2013 were a revolutionary approach to supplying workplace footwear. We had analyzed the current environment of how most companies were buying their safety shoes with the mission of improving efficiency, selection and savings. Now we’ve advanced that custom service even more by making these styles available for immediate delivery. This Lehigh exclusive collection makes it easier than ever for our customers to quickly acquire affordable boots to fit new hires or replacements.”</p>

<p>QuickFit style LEHI009 is ideal for most heavy industrial applications. The six-inch waterproof boots also feature 100 grams of 3M™ Thinsulate™ insulation and electrical hazard protection.</p>

<p>QuickFit style LEHI015 is an exceptional general-use boot. Made from real leather, the six-inch boot features electrical hazard protection along with a removable polyurethane footbed and PVC outsole for shock absorbtion and all-day comfort and support.</p>

<p>Shipping on any QuickFit order is free and FedEx next business day delivery is guaranteed on any order placed before 1 p.m. EST. (where service is applicable). $89.00 per pair is available on CustomFit Corporate Shoe Program sites only.</p>

          <div class="card-text truncate3"><p>One of Lehigh’s core values is safety and we support any initiative that shares and promotes that value to the customers we serve. The 3rd annual Steel Safety Day on April 28th, established by the World Steel Association (WSA), reinforces creating and maintaining a safer work environment across the entire steel industry.</p>

<p>At inception, the WSA defined the 5 most common major causes of workplace safety incidents to focus on - moving machinery, falling from heights, falling items, gas and asphyxiation, and moving cranes. Each year one of the causes is highlighted with knowledge and information for prevention. This year focuses on Staying Safe While Working At Height. Check out this detailed graphic the WSA put together to help better understand the safety practices to reduce risk.</p>

<p><strong>In addition:</strong></p>

<p>The above practices are excellent points in helping to prevent an occurance or hazard. Lehigh also highly recommends always enforcing a safety footwear policy and requirement for steady footing when working from any height or on a ladder.</p>

<p>For the steel industry our most commonly purchased footwear is MetGuards. This type of boot incorporates an extra piece of durable material that lays on top of the boot to protect the metatarsal bones of the foot from heavy impact. Lehigh carries a wide variety of styles in both internal and external options. If you have a CustomFit account check them out here.</p>

<p>For employees who spend any time working at height on a ladder, the right boot makes all the difference. The best boot to have is a debris-releasing, anti-slip outsole with a right-angled heel for proper rung gripping. Check out our more in-depth article about Boots and Ladders.</p>

          <div class="card-text truncate3"><p>The Washington State Department of Labor and Industries has issued a Safety Hazard Alert to anyone who uses products containing hydrofluoric (HF) acid, especially those who work in commercial car washes and auto detail as car and truck washes and rust removers and brighteners are likely to contain it. In Washington alone, one worker has died and 48 have been burned after exposure to car and truck wash.</p>

<p>Protection is highly important! You should stop using all products that contain HF if possible. Researchers found that “Products containing both diluted-use concentrations of less than 1 percent HF and concentrated formulations of up to 20 percent HF are dangerous to workers.”</p>

<p>These incidents and cases stress the necessity of always wearing proper PPE such as gloves, face shields and boots, when working with solvents and chemicals as you never know what may be dangerous or harmful to you. Our selection of rubber boots is superior to most – log into your CustomFit site and check them out. If you need to protect and provide for your workers but don’t have a safety shoe program, we are confident you’ll find the quality safety boots and service you need with us – <a href="http://www.customfit.me/customfit">Get CustomFit Today</a>!</p>

          <div class="card-text truncate3"><p>Across the US, more then 80,000 construction workers suffer an injury on the job site every year. That’s incredible; and it’s obviously way too many. So, the over 40 national and global construction firms making up CISI (the Construction Industry Safety Initiative) and IIF (the Incident and Injury-Free Executive Forum) have come together for the 2nd Annual US Industry Safety Week May 3rd through the 9th.</p>

<p>Construction firms of all sizes across the country are encouraged to work together to eliminate worker injury. SafetyWeek2015.com states the collective mission of the campaign is to partner together in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Thanking workers for supporting safety and recognizing their efforts to be injury free</li>
  <li>Increasing awareness of the importance of being committed to safety, every day</li>
  <li>Inspiring all of us to share best practices and to work together to strengthen our industry’s safety culture</li>
  <li>Celebrating the need to be injury free</li>
  <li>Conducting on-site safety awareness activities to support education</li>
  <li>Companies, Safety Directors, Foremen, Shift Supervisors and Human Resources need to take this opportunity to recommit and focus-in on reducing jobsite injuries. If not this week, designate another specific week for your workers to demonstrate your commitment to the value of their lives and the work they do. Pledge to make a difference and to be a leader in safety.</li>

          <!-- <h4 class="card-title truncate2">2015 National Safety Stand-Down</h4> -->
          <div class="card-text truncate3"><p>Because falls are the leading cause of death in construction, OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) is conducting the 2nd Annual National Safety Stand-Down campaign to raise awareness of the impact of fall hazards and how to prevent them. Any construction company or organization that wants to prevent falls in their workplace is highly encouraged to participate - commercial, residential, highway, sub- and independent contractors, unions, trade associations, etc.</p>

<p>This year’s event is May 4-15; but if you haven’t started it’s not too late. OSHA continuously provides and updates resources and training to help you communicate to your employees how to prevent falls in various situations such as on bridges, scaffolds, towers and roofs using specific equipment like ladders and tools. Lehigh CustomFit also provides helpful resource articles in our Safety Resource Center.</p>

<p>The campaign promotes three simple steps to preventing falls – Plan, Provide, Train. Planning ahead is important so that you know your work environment and people on the job in order to Provide the right gear, tools and necessary equipment to do the job safely. Training on proper usage of equipment and knowing when to use it is critical.</p>

<p>One key tool that every construction worker needs and good employers provide an allowance for is proper safety footwear. The right pair of boots can help prevent slipping in numerous conditions, such as working on a ladder, by aiding in worker balance and providing better grip with a specific outsole construction. Check out our <a href="http://www.customfit.me/safetyresourcecenter/BOOTS_AND_LADDERS/">Boots and Ladder</a> article in our Safety Resource Center for proper ladder safety.</p>

          <div class="card-text truncate3"><p>One of Lehigh’s core values is safety and we support any initiative that shares and promotes that value to the customers we serve. Last year the World Steel Association (WSA) established Steel Safety Day to reinforce creating and maintaining a safer work environment across the entire steel industry. Before this year’s Steel Safety Day on April 28th the industry was encouraged to conduct an extensive safety audit with the goal of raising awareness and achieving an injury-free, illness-free workplace.</p>

<p>The WSA defined the 5 most common major causes of workplace safety incidents to focus on - moving machinery, falling from heights, falling items, gas and asphyxiation, and moving cranes. Each year one of the causes will be highlighted with knowledge and information for prevention. This year focuses on moving machinery. Check out this detailed graphic the WSA put together to help better understand the safety practices to reduce risk.</p>

<p>##In Addition</p>

<p>The above practices are excellent points in helping to prevent an occurance or hazard. Lehigh also highly recommends always enforcing a safety footwear policy and requirement to ensure protection in the event of an accident. For the steel industry our most commonly purchased footwear is MetGuards. This type of boot incorporates an extra piece of durable material that lays on top of the boot to protect the metatarsal bones of the foot from heavy impact. Lehigh carries a wide variety of styles in both internal and external options. If you have a CustomFit account check them out here.
