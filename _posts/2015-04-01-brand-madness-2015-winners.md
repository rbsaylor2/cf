Lehigh is proud to introduce Sonya Williams - our newest Lehigh District Sales Manager covering the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. "We are thrilled to have Sonya on board to actively seek out and develop new business, as well as manage and engage existing business, in this territory," said Jim Murphy, regional vice president of sales.

Williams is a graduate of Tennessee State University with a master's degree in education. In addition, she holds bachelor's degrees in business administration, marketing, and business information systems. She has over 13 years selling experience. Prior to joing Lehigh, she worked selling GPS monitoring solutions online to governmental and private agencies. We have no doubt that both her professional and educational experience will lead to her success with Lehigh Outfitters.
